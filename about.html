          <p class="">One Heart Ministries is a Christian ministry that attends to people’s spiritual needs as it serves their human
            needs. The Ministry is based upon the word of God as set forth in the Holy Bible. The ultimate objective of The
            Ministry is to lead people to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and then to help them become Disciples
            of Christ to serve and minister to the needs of others. The Ministry is not a church; instead, it encourages
            the people to whom it ministers to become active members of a Christian church of their choice.
            <br>
            <br>The Ministry serves independently of other organizations; however, it also seeks to work in conjunction with
            other charitable organizations, churches, schools, community organizations, clubs and groups to serve the needs
            of people.
            <br>
            <br>The Ministry seeks to serve all people without regard to age, race, sex, national origin, disability, social
            and economic status, or any other distinctions. Among other things, The Ministry conducts activities that seek
            to promote: relief of the poor, the distressed and the underprivileged; advancement of the Christian religion;
            lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; and combating community deterioration
            and juvenile delinquency.
            <br>
            <br>The Ministry serves young people by providing Bible study and spiritual fellowship in conjunction with other
            activities to include athletics, music, art, drama, academic tutoring, and other similar activities.
            <br>
            <br>The Ministry leads the young people in providing community service, including service to seniors, to the disabled,
            and to the economically disadvantaged and underprivileged. The Ministry engages in ministry throughout the community
            and beyond, including people in prison, their families and people released from prison, to assist in their human
            rehabilitation and spiritual transformation.
            <br>
            <br>The Ministry is a Georgia nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and religious purposes pursuant
            to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>
